UI-Router State Transitions
===========================

Sliding animation between application state using [UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router). Design taken from [Codrops](https://github.com/codrops)'s [Full screen layout with page transitions demo](https://github.com/codrops/FullscreenLayoutPageTransitions/). Takes advantages of UI-Router's deep-linking capabilities.

###Installation

1. $ npm install && bower install to install dependencies
2. $ gulp to compile build directory and start browser-sync server

###Demo

[Plunkr](http://embed.plnkr.co/fyGPr9/preview) (normally you would see the URL update as you're navigating between states, but Plunkr uses iframes to display content, so I put back buttons into the demo example)
